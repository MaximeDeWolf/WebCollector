# WebCollector

**WebCollector** is a little Python 3 library that allows you to gather the source code of a web page
and to **easily** browse it. You can extract some parts of this code by means of XPath expressions.
It also offers an **intuitive** mean to store these data in a dictionnary data structure.
This data structure thus permit you to save these data into a *json* or *yaml* file.

## Dependencies

**WebCollector** depends on two external Python libraries:
* urllib3
* lxml

If you have any problems with **WebCollector** just try to update (or install) them.

## Goal

The main goal of this library is to provide **intuitive** means to **easily** gather informations from web pages.

## Todo list

- [ ] Make some python script examples to show how to use the functionalities of **WebCollector**.
- [ ] Find a better name for the functions already written.
- [ ] Provide new functions to allow the user to do some post-treatment.
- [ ] Post **WebCollector** on the Python package manager
