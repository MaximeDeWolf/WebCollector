# WebCollector

## What is that ?

This is a little Python 3 library that allows you to gather the source code of a web page
and to **easily** browse it. You can extract some parts of this code by means of the XPath expressions.
It also offers an **intuitive** mean to store these data in a dictionnary data structure.
This data structure thus permit you to save these data into a *json* or *yaml* file.
